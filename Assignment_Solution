Goal 
The purpose of this assignment is to showcase your skills in analyzing business needs and in utilizing Python and SQL to provide solutions. 
Assignment 
Scenario: 
Company XYZ held a promo sale for their signature items named: x,y,z. Sales are at an all-time high, but they want to create a marketing strategy to target age groups of people by looking at total quantities purchased. 
They then created a database with these business rules: 
• A sales receipt can have multiple items in an order. 
• For every order, the clerk records all quantities for all items, including items not bought (which they denote with quantity=NULL). 
• Each customer can do multiple sales transactions, and has his/her age stored in a database. 
Refer to the image below for the table structures and relationships. 

Objectives 
Create a Python script that can: 
1. connect to the SQLite3 database provided 
2. extract the total quantities of each item bought per customer aged 18-35. - For each customer, get the sum of each item 
- Items with no purchase (total quantity=0) should be omitted from the final list 
- No decimal points allowed (The company doesn’t sell half of an item ;) ) Challenge: Provide 2 solutions, one using purely SQL, the other using Pandas 3. store the query to a CSV file, delimiter should be the semicolon character (';')
Test case: 
Customer 1 bought Item X on multiple occasions, totaling 10 for Item X only Customer 2 bought one of each item only once, totaling 1 each Item Customer 3 bought Item Z on two occasions, totaling 2 for Item Z only Then the output file should look like the example below: 
Customer;Age;Item;Quantity 
1;21;x;10 
2;23;x;1 
2;23;y;1 
2;23;z;1 
3;35;z;2(Note: Actual values will vary) 




SOLUTION:


SQL Query:

SELECT
    c.customer_id AS Customer,
    c.age AS Age,
    i.item_name AS Item,
    CAST(SUM(s.quantity) AS INTEGER) AS Quantity
FROM customers c
JOIN sales s ON c.customer_id = s.customer_id
JOIN items i ON s.item_id = i.item_id
WHERE c.age BETWEEN 18 AND 35
  AND s.quantity IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.age, i.item_name
HAVING SUM(s.quantity) > 0
ORDER BY c.customer_id;


Python Scripit(SQL > CSV): 

import sqlite3
import csv

conn = sqlite3.connect("sales.db")
cursor = conn.cursor()

query = """
SELECT
    c.customer_id AS Customer,
    c.age AS Age,
    i.item_name AS Item,
    CAST(SUM(s.quantity) AS INTEGER) AS Quantity
FROM customers c
JOIN sales s ON c.customer_id = s.customer_id
JOIN items i ON s.item_id = i.item_id
WHERE c.age BETWEEN 18 AND 35
  AND s.quantity IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.age, i.item_name
HAVING SUM(s.quantity) > 0
ORDER BY c.customer_id;
"""

rows = cursor.execute(query).fetchall()

with open("output_sql.csv", "w", newline="") as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f, delimiter=";")
    writer.writerow(["Customer", "Age", "Item", "Quantity"])
    writer.writerows(rows)

conn.close()

* HAVING SUM(quantity)>0 removes non-purchased items
* CAST(..AS INETGER) avoids decimals



Python Script (Pandas):

import sqlite3
import pandas as pd

# Connect to DB
conn = sqlite3.connect("sales.db")

# Load tables
customers = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM customers", conn)
sales = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM sales", conn)
items = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM items", conn)

# Merge tables
df = sales.merge(customers, on="customer_id") \
          .merge(items, on="item_id")

# Filter age group and valid quantities
df = df[(df["age"].between(18, 35)) & (df["quantity"].notna())]

# Aggregate
result = (
    df.groupby(["customer_id", "age", "item_name"])["quantity"]
    .sum()
    .reset_index()
)

# Remove zero quantities
result = result[result["quantity"] > 0]

# Convert to int
result["quantity"] = result["quantity"].astype(int)

# Rename columns
result.columns = ["Customer", "Age", "Item", "Quantity"]

# Export to CSV
result.to_csv("output_pandas.csv", sep=";", index=False)

conn.close() 



* Pandas groupby().sum() handles multiple purchases
* notna() removes NULL quantities
* Explict astype(int) ensures no decimals
* Output matches required format exactly




OUTPUT:

Customer;Age;Item;Quantity 
1;21;x;10 
2;23;x;1 
2;23;y;1 
2;23;z;1 
3;35;z;2
